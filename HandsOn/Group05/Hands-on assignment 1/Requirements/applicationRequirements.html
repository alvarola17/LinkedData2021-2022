        With the information obtained from our dataset, we will create an app oriented to electrical companies 
        that will provide the buildings in Madrid which use solar energy and its relation to others. This can 
        provide to the companies key information on where to put more solar pannels, which buildings produce more 
        solar energy in order to supply the energy to the ones that need it the most. 
        All that applications, will give economical benefits to electrical companies, eficient ways to distribute 
        solar energy, shrink the carbon footprint, etc.
